# Assumptions Log

This log captures every assumption, uncertainty, and decision that impacts behavior, scope, or correctness.

## Format
| ID | Date (YYYY-MM-DD) | Assumption | Rationale / Evidence | Impact | Confidence (L/M/H) | Status (Open/Validated/Invalidated) | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Notes
- If an assumption is later validated or invalidated, update the Status and add evidence.
- Use one row per assumption.
